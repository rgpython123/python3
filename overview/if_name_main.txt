   TLDR: Ensure that code is not run when the module is imported.

   EXAMPLE:

Create the following files.

$ vim a.py
+++
import b
+++

   AND

$ vim b.py
+++
print "Hello World from %s!" % __name__

if __name__ == '__main__':
    print "Hello World again from %s!" % __name__
+++


Running them will get you this output:

$ python a.py
Hello World from b!

As you can see, when a module is imported, Python sets globals()['__name__'] in this module to the module's name. Also, upon import all the code in the module is being run. As the if statement evaluates to False this part is not executed.

$ python b.py
Hello World from __main__!
Hello World again from __main__!

As you can see, when a file is executed, Python sets globals()['__name__'] in this file to "__main__". This time, the if statement evaluates to True and is being run.
