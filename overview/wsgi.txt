WSGI:

The Web Server Gateway Interface (WSGI, pronounced whiskey)
 is a simple calling convention for web servers to forward
 requests to web applications or frameworks written in the
 Python programming language.

In 2003, Python web frameworks were typically written against
 only CGI, FastCGI, mod_python, or some other custom API of a
 specific web server.[5] To quote PEP 333:

    Python currently boasts a wide variety of web application
 frameworks, such as Zope, Quixote, Webware, SkunkWeb, PSO,
 and Twisted Web -- to name just a few. This wide variety of
 choices can be a problem for new Python users, because generally
 speaking, their choice of web framework will limit their choice
 of usable web servers, and vice versa... By contrast, although
 Java has just as many web application frameworks available,
 Java's "servlet" API makes it possible for applications written
 with any Java web application framework to run in any web server
 that supports the servlet API.

WSGI was thus created as an implementation-agnostic interface
 between web servers and web applications or frameworks to promote
 common ground for portable web application development.
