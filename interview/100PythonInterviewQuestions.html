          <h3>
           Q-1: What is Python, what are the benefits of using it, and what do you understand of PEP 8?
          </h3>
          <p>
           Python is one of the most successful interpreted languages. When you write a Python script, it doesn‚Äôt need to get compiled before execution. Few other interpreted languages are PHP and Javascript.
          </p>
          <h4>
           Benefits of Python Programming
          </h4>
          <ul>
           <li>
            Python is a dynamic-typed language. It means that you don‚Äôt need to mention the data type of variables during their declaration. It allows to set variables like var1=101 and var2 =‚Äù You are an engineer.‚Äù without any error.
           </li>
           <li>
            Python supports object orientated programming as you can define classes along with the composition and inheritance. It doesn‚Äôt use access specifiers like public or private).
           </li>
           <li>
            Functions in Python are like first-class objects. It suggests you can assign them to variables, return from other methods and pass as arguments.
           </li>
           <li>
            Developing using Python is quick but running it is often slower than compiled languages. Luckily, Python enables to include the ‚ÄúC‚Äù language extensions so you can optimize your scripts.
           </li>
           <li>
            Python has several usages like web-based applications, test automation, data modeling, big data analytics and much more. Alternatively, you can¬†utilize it as a ‚Äúglue‚Äù layer to work with other languages.
           </li>
          </ul>
          <h4>
           PEP 8.
          </h4>
          <p>
           PEP 8 is the latest Python coding standard, a set of coding recommendations. It guides to deliver more readable¬†Python code.

           Q-2: What is the output of the following Python code fragment? Justify your answer.
          </h3>
          <pre class="lang:python decode:true">def extendList(val, list=[]):
    list.append(val)
    return list

list1 = extendList(10)
list2 = extendList(123,[])
list3 = extendList('a')

print "list1 = %s" % list1
print "list2 = %s" % list2
print "list3 = %s" % list3</pre>
          <p>
           The result of the above Python code snippet is:
          </p>
          <pre class="lang:python decode:true">list1 = [10, 'a']
list2 = [123]
list3 = [10, 'a']</pre>
          <p>
           You may erroneously expect list1 to be equal to [10] and list3 to match with [‚Äòa‚Äô], thinking that the list argument will initialize to its default value of [] every time there is a call to the extendList.
          </p>
          <p>
           However, the flow is like that a new list gets created once after the function is defined. And the same get used whenever someone calls the extendList method without a list argument. It works like this because the calculation of expressions (in default arguments)¬†occurs at the time of function definition, not during its invocation.
          </p>
          <p>
           The¬†list1 and list3 are hence operating on the same default list, whereas list2 is running on a separate object that it has created on its own (by passing an empty list as the value of the list parameter).
          </p>
          <p>
           The definition of the extendList function can get changed in the following manner.
          </p>
          <pre class="lang:python decode:true">def extendList(val, list=None):
  if list is None:
    list = []
  list.append(val)
  return list</pre>
          <p>
           With this revised implementation, the output would be:
          </p>
          <pre class="lang:python decode:true">list1 = [10]
list2 = [123]
list3 = ['a']</pre>

          </h3>
          <ul>
           <li>
            Python uses private heaps to maintain its memory. So the heap holds all the Python objects and the data structures. This area is only accessible to the Python interpreter;¬†programmers can‚Äôt use it.
           </li>
           <li>
            And it‚Äôs the¬†Python¬†memory manager that handles the¬†Private heap. It does the required allocation of the memory for Python objects.
           </li>
           <li>
            Python employs a built-in garbage collector, which salvages all the unused memory and offloads it to the heap space.

           </li>
           <li>
            Def generates a function and designates a name to call it later. Lambda forms a function¬†object and returns it.

           Q-16: What is a string in Python?
          </h3>
          <p>
           A string in Python is a sequence of alpha-numeric characters. They are immutable objects. It means that they don‚Äôt allow modification once they get assigned a value. Python provides several methods, such as join(), replace(), or split() to alter strings. But none of these change the original object.

           Q-17: What is slicing in Python?
          </h3>
          <p>
           Slicing is a string operation for extracting a part of the string, or some part of a list. In Python, a string (say text) begins at index 0, and the nth character stores at position text[n-1]. Python can also perform reverse indexing, i.e., in the backward direction, with the help of negative numbers. In Python, the slice() is also a constructor function which generates a slice object. The result is a set of indices mentioned by range(start, stop, step). The slice() method allows three parameters. 1. start ‚Äì starting number for the slicing to begin. 2. stop ‚Äì the number which indicates the end of slicing. 3. step ‚Äì the value to increment after each index (default = 1).

          </p>
          <p>
           One of the common usages is to push values into a string with the %s format specifier. The formatting operation in Python has the comparable syntax as the C function printf() has.

           Q-19: Is a string immutable or mutable in Python?
          </h3>
          <p>
           Python strings are indeed immutable.
          </p>
          <p>
           Let‚Äôs take an example. We have an ‚Äústr‚Äù variable holding a string value. We can‚Äôt mutate the container, i.e., the string, but can modify what it contains that means the value of the variable.
          </p>
          <h3>
           Q-20: What is the index in Python?
          </h3>
          <p>
           An index is an integer data type which denotes a position within an ordered list or a string.
          </p>
          <p>
           In Python, strings are also lists of characters. We can access them using the index which begins from zero and goes to the length minus one.
          </p>
          <p>
           For example, in the string ‚ÄúProgram,‚Äù the indexing happens like this:
          </p>
          <pre>Program 0 1 2 3 4 5</pre>

           Q-21: What is Docstring in Python?
          </h3>
          <p>
           A docstring is a unique text that happens to be the first statement in the following Python constructs:
          </p>
          <p>
           Module, Function, Class, or Method definition.
          </p>
          <p>
           A docstring gets added to the __doc__ attribute of the string object.

           Q-22: What is a function in Python programming?
          </h3>
          <p>
           A function is an object which represents a block of code and is a reusable entity. It brings modularity to a program and a higher degree of code reusability.
          </p>
          <p>
           Python has given us many built-in functions such as print() and provides the ability to create user-defined functions.
          </p>
          <h3>
           Q-23: How many basic types of functions are available in Python?
          </h3>
          <p>
           Python gives us two basic types of functions.
          </p>
          <p>
           1. Built-in, and
          </p>
          <p>
           2. User-defined.
          </p>
          <p>
           The built-in functions happen to be part of the Python language. Some of these are print(), dir(), len(), and abs() etc.
          </p>
          <h3>
           Q-24: How do we write a function in Python?
          </h3>
          <p>
           We can create a Python function in the following manner.
          </p>
          <p>
           Step-1: to begin the function, start writing with the keyword def and then mention the function name.
          </p>
          <p>
           Step-2: We can now pass the arguments and enclose them using the parentheses. A colon, in the end, marks the end of the function header.
          </p>
          <p>
           Step-3: After pressing an enter, we can add the desired Python statements for execution.
          </p>

           Q-25: What is a function call or a callable object in Python?
          </h3>
          <p>
           A function in Python gets treated as a callable object. It can allow some arguments and also return a value or multiple values in the form of a tuple. Apart from the function, Python has other constructs, such as classes or the class instances which fits in the same category.
          </p>
          <h3>
           Q-26: What is the return keyword used for in Python?
          </h3>
          <p>
           The purpose of a function is to receive the inputs and return some output.
          </p>
          <p>
           The return is a Python statement which we can use in a function for sending a value back to its caller.
          </p>
          <h3>
           Q-27: What is ‚ÄúCall by Value‚Äù in Python?
          </h3>
          <p>
           In call-by-value, the argument whether an expression or a value gets bound to the respective variable in the function.
          </p>
          <p>
           Python will treat that variable as local in the function-level scope. Any changes made to that variable will remain local and will not reflect outside the function.
          </p>
          <h3>
           Q-28: What is ‚ÄúCall by Reference‚Äù in Python?
          </h3>
          <p>
           We use both ‚Äúcall-by-reference‚Äù and ‚Äúpass-by-reference‚Äù interchangeably. When we pass an argument by reference, then it is available as an implicit reference to the function, rather than a simple copy. In such a case, any modification to the argument will also be visible to the caller.
          </p>
          <p>
           This scheme also has the advantage of bringing more time and space efficiency because it leaves the need for creating local copies.
          </p>
          <p>
           On the contrary, the disadvantage could be that a variable can get changed accidentally during a function call. Hence, the programmers need to handle in the code to avoid such uncertainty.

           Q-29: What is the return value of the trunc() function?
          </h3>
          <p>
           The Python trunc() function performs a mathematical operation to remove the decimal values from a particular expression and provides an integer value as its output.

           The continue is a jump statement in Python which moves the control to execute the next iteration in a loop leaving all the remaining instructions in the block unexecuted.
          </p>
          <p>
           The continue statement is applicable for both the ‚Äúwhile‚Äù and ‚Äúfor‚Äù loops.

          <p>
           We use *args as a parameter in the function header. It gives us the ability to pass N (variable) number of arguments.
          </p>
          <p>
           Please note that this type of argument syntax doesn‚Äôt allow passing a named argument to the function.

           Q-35: Does Python have a Main() method?
          </h3>
          <p>
           The main() is the entry point function which happens to be called first in most programming languages.
          </p>
          <p>
           Since Python is interpreter-based, so it sequentially executes the lines of the code one-by-one.
          </p>
          <p>
           Python also does have a Main() method. But it gets executed whenever we run our Python script either by directly clicking it or starts it from the command line.
          </p>
          <p>
           We can also override the Python default main() function using the Python if statement. Please see the below code.
          </p>
          <pre>print("Welcome")
print("__name__ contains: ", __name__)
def main():
    print("Testing the main function")
if __name__ == '__main__':

           Q-36: What does the __ Name __ do in Python?
          </h3>
          <p>
           The __name__ is a unique variable. Since Python doesn‚Äôt expose the main() function, so when its interpreter gets to run the script, it first executes the code which is at level 0 indentation.
          </p>
          <p>
           To see whether the main() gets called, we can use the __name__ variable in an if clause compares with the value ‚Äú__main__.‚Äù

          <p>
           Python provides a break statement to exit from a loop. Whenever the break hits in the code, the control of the program immediately exits from the body of the loop.
          </p>
          <p>
           The break statement in a nested loop causes the control to exit from the inner iterative block.

           Q-51: What is GIL in Python language?
          </h3>
          <p>
           Python supports GIL (the global interpreter lock) which is a mutex used to secure access to Python objects, synchronizing multiple threads from running the Python bytecodes at the same time.
          </p>
          <h3>
           Q-52: How is Python thread safe?
          </h3>
          <p>
           Python ensures safe access to threads. It uses the GIL mutex to set synchronization. If a thread loses the GIL lock at any time, then you have to make the code thread-safe.
          </p>
          <p>
           For example, many of the Python operations execute as atomic such as calling the sort() method on a list.

          <p>
           The collection is a set of keys having a single associated value. We can call it a hash, a map, or a hashmap as it gets called in other programming languages.
          </p>
          <h3>
           Q-56: What is the set object in Python?
          </h3>
          <p>
           Sets are unordered collection objects in Python. They store unique and immutable objects. Python has its implementation derived from mathematics.
          </p>
          <h3>
           Q-57: What is the use of the dictionary in Python?
          </h3>
          <p>
           A dictionary has a group of objects (the keys) map to another group of objects (the values). A Python dictionary represents a mapping of unique Keys to Values.
          </p>
          <p>
           They are mutable and hence will not change. The values associated with the keys can be of any Python types.
          </p>

           Q-58: Is Python list a linked list?
          </h3>
          <p>
           A Python list is a variable-length array which is different from C-style linked lists.
          </p>
          <p>
           Internally, it has a contiguous array for referencing to other objects and stores a pointer to the array variable and its length in the list head structure.
          </p>
          <p>
           Here are some Python interview questions on classes and objects.
          </p>
          <h3>
           Q-59: What is Class in Python?
          </h3>
          <p>
           Python supports object-oriented programming and provides almost all OOP features to use in programs.
          </p>
          <p>
           A Python class is a blueprint for creating the objects. It defines member variables and gets their behavior associated with them.
          </p>
          <p>
           We can make it by using the keyword ‚Äúclass.‚Äù An object gets created from the constructor. This object represents the instance of the class.
          </p>
          <p>
           In Python, we generate classes and instances in the following way.
          </p>
          <pre>&gt;&gt;&gt;class Human:  # Create the class
...     pass
&gt;&gt;&gt;man = Human()  # Create the instance
&gt;&gt;&gt;print(man)
&lt;__main__.Human object at 0x0000000003559E10&gt;</pre>
          <h3>
           Q-60: What are Attributes and Methods in a Python class?
          </h3>
          <p>
           A class is useless if it has not defined any functionality. We can do so by adding attributes. They work as containers for data and functions. We can add an attribute directly specifying inside the class body.
          </p>
          <pre>&gt;&gt;&gt; class Human:
...     profession = "programmer" # specify the attribute 'profession' of the class
&gt;&gt;&gt; man = Human()
&gt;&gt;&gt; print(man.profession)
programmer</pre>
          <p>
           After we added the attributes, we can go on to define the functions. Generally, we call them methods. In the method signature, we always have to provide the first argument with a self-keyword.
          </p>
          <pre>&gt;&gt;&gt; class Human:
    profession = "programmer"
    def set_profession(self, new_profession):
        self.profession = new_profession      
&gt;&gt;&gt; man = Human()
&gt;&gt;&gt; man.set_profession("Manager")
&gt;&gt;&gt; print(man.profession)
Manager</pre>
          <h3>
           Q-61: How to assign values for the Class attributes at runtime?
          </h3>
          <p>
           We can specify the values for the attributes at runtime. We need to add an init method and pass input to object constructor. See the following example demonstrating this.
          </p>
          <pre>&gt;&gt;&gt; class Human:
    def __init__(self, profession):
        self.profession = profession
    def set_profession(self, new_profession):
        self.profession = new_profession

&gt;&gt;&gt; man = Human("Manager")
&gt;&gt;&gt; print(man.profession)
Manager</pre>

           Q-62: What is Inheritance in Python programming?
          </h3>
          <p>
           Inheritance is an OOP mechanism which allows an object to access its parent class features. It carries forward the base class functionality to the child.
          </p>
          <p>

          </p>
          <p>
           We do it intentionally to abstract away the similar code in different classes.
          </p>
          <p>
           The common code rests with the base class, and the child class objects can access it via inheritance. Check out the below example.
          </p>
          <pre>class PC: # Base class
    processor = "Xeon" # Common attribute
    def set_processor(self, new_processor):
        processor = new_processor

class Desktop(PC): # Derived class
    os = "Mac OS High Sierra" # Personalized attribute
    ram = "32 GB"

class Laptop(PC): # Derived class
    os = "Windows 10 Pro 64" # Personalized attribute
    ram = "16 GB"

desk = Desktop()
print(desk.processor, desk.os, desk.ram)

lap = Laptop()
print(lap.processor, lap.os, lap.ram)</pre>
          <p>
           The output:
          </p>
          <pre>Xeon Mac OS High Sierra 32 GB
Xeon Windows 10 Pro 64 16 GB</pre>
          <h3>
           Q-63: What is Composition in Python?
          </h3>
          <p>
           The composition is also a type of inheritance in Python. It intends to inherit from the base class but a little differently, i.e., by using an instance variable of the base class acting as a member of the derived class.
          </p>
          <p>
           See the below diagram.
          </p>
          <p>
           <img alt="Python Interview Questions - Composition" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-7089" height="171" sizes="(max-width: 354px) 100vw, 354px" src="https://cdn.techbeamers.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Python-Interview-Questions-Composition.png" srcset="https://cdn.techbeamers.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Python-Interview-Questions-Composition.png 354w, https://cdn.techbeamers.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Python-Interview-Questions-Composition-300x145.png 300w" width="354"/>
          </p>
          <p>
           To demonstrate composition, we need to instantiate other objects in the class and then make use of those instances.
          </p>
          <pre>class PC: # Base class
    processor = "Xeon" # Common attribute
    def __init__(self, processor, ram):
        self.processor = processor
        self.ram = ram

           Q-64: What are Errors and Exceptions in Python programs?
          </h3>
          <p>
           Errors are coding issues in a program which may cause it to exit abnormally.
          </p>
          <p>
           On the contrary, exceptions happen due to the occurrence of an external event which interrupts the normal flow of the program.

          <h3>
           Q-65: How do you handle exceptions with Try/Except/Finally in Python?
          </h3>
          <p>
           Python lay down Try, Except, Finally constructs to handle errors as well as Exceptions. We enclose the unsafe code indented under the try block. And we can keep our fall-back code inside the except block. Any instructions intended for execution last should come under the finally block.
          </p>
          <pre>try:
    print("Executing code in the try block")
    print(exception)
except:
    print("Entering in the except block")
finally:
    print("Reached to the final block")</pre>

           Q-66: How do you raise exceptions for a predefined condition in Python?
          </h3>
          <p>
           We can raise an exception based on some condition.
          </p>
          <p>
           For example, if we want the user to enter only odd numbers, else will raise an exception.

          <pre># Example - Raise an exception
while True:
    try:
        value = int(input("Enter an odd number- "))

           Q-67: What are Python Iterators?
          </h3>
          <p>
           Iterators in Python are array-like objects which allow moving on the next element. We use them in traversing a loop, for example, in a ‚Äúfor‚Äù loop.
          </p>
          <p>
           Python library has a no. of iterators. For example, a list is also an iterator and we can start a for loop over it.

          </h3>
          <p>
           The collection type like a list, tuple, dictionary, and set are all iterable objects whereas they are also iterable containers which return an iterator while traversing.

           Q-72: How do you create a dictionary in Python?

          <p>
           Let‚Äôs take the example of building site statistics. For this, we first need to break up the key-value pairs using a colon(‚Äú:‚Äù). The keys should be of an immutable type, i.e., so we‚Äôll use the data-types which don‚Äôt allow changes at runtime. We‚Äôll choose from an int, string, or tuple.
          </p>
          <p>
           However, we can take values of any kind. For distinguishing the data pairs, we can use a comma(‚Äú,‚Äù) and keep the whole stuff inside curly braces({‚Ä¶}).

           A dictionary has the same syntax as was for the list comprehension but the difference is that it uses curly braces:

          <pre>{ aKey, itsValue for aKey in iterable }</pre>

           Q-82: What do you know about the Python enumerate?
          </h3>
          <p>
           While using the iterators, sometimes we might have a use case to store the count of iterations. Python gets this task quite easy for us by giving a built-in method known as the enumerate().
          </p>
          <p>
           The enumerate() function attaches a counter variable to an iterable and returns it as the ‚Äúenumerated‚Äù object.
          </p>
          <p>
           We can use this object directly in the ‚Äúfor‚Äù loops or transform it into a list of tuples by calling the list() method. It has the following signature:
          </p>
          <pre>enumerate(iterable, to_begin=0)</pre>
          <pre>Arguments:
iterable: array type object which enables iteration
to_begin: the base index for the counter is to get started, its default value is 0</pre>
          <pre># Example - enumerate function 
alist = ["apple","mango", "orange"] 
astr = "banana"
  
# Let's set the enumerate objects 
list_obj = enumerate(alist) 
str_obj = enumerate(astr) 
  
print("list_obj type:", type(list_obj))
print("str_obj type:", type(str_obj))

print(list(enumerate(alist)) )  
# Move the starting index to two from zero
print(list(enumerate(astr, 2)))</pre>
          <p>
           The output is:
          </p>
          <pre>list_obj type: &lt;class 'enumerate'&gt;
str_obj type: &lt;class 'enumerate'&gt;

          </p>
          <p>
           Python maintains a symbol table to keep all necessary information about a program. This info includes the names of variables, methods, and classes used by the program.
          </p>
          <p>
           All the information in this table remains in the global scope of the program and Python allows us to retrieve it using the globals() method.

           Q-85: What are Class or Static Variables in Python programming?
          </h3>
          <p>
           In Python, all the objects share common class or static variables.
          </p>
          <p>
           But the instance or non-static variables are altogether different for different objects.
          </p>
          <p>
           The programming languages like C++ and Java need to use the static keyword to make a variable as the class variable. However, Python has a unique way to declare a static variable.
          </p>
          <p>
           All names initialized with a value in the class declaration becomes the class variables. And those which get assigned values in the class methods becomes the instance variables.
          </p>
          <pre># Example 
class Test: 
    aclass = 'programming' # A class variable 
    def __init__(self, ainst): 
        self.ainst = ainst # An instance variable 
  
# Objects of CSStudent class 
test1 = Test(1) 
test2 = Test(2)

          </h3>
          <p>
           A generator in Python is a function which returns an iterable object. We can iterate on the generator object using the
           <strong>
            yield
           </strong>
           keyword. But we can only do that once because their values don‚Äôt persist in memory, they get the values on the fly.
          </p>
          <p>
           Generators give us the ability to hold the execution of a function or a step as long as we want to keep it. However, here are a few examples where it is beneficial to use generators.
          </p>
          <ul>
           <li>
            We can replace loops with generators for efficiently calculating results involving large data sets.
           </li>
           <li>
            Generators are¬†useful when we don‚Äôt want all the results and wish to hold back for some time.
           </li>
           <li>
            Instead of¬†using a callback function, we can replace it with a generator. We can write a loop inside the function doing the same thing as the callback and turns it into a generator.

           Call Python‚Äôs
           <strong>
            tuple()
           </strong>
           function for converting a list into a tuple.
          </p>
          <p>
           This function takes the list as its argument.
          </p>
          <p>
           But remember, we can‚Äôt change the list after turning it into a tuple because it becomes immutable.
          </p>
          <pre class="lang:python decode:true">weekdays = ['sun','mon','tue','wed','thu','fri','sat']

           Turn a list into a set.
          </h4>
          <p>
           Converting a list to a set poses two side-effects.
          </p>
          <ul>
           <li>
            Set doesn‚Äôt allow duplicate entries so that the¬†conversion will remove any such item.
           </li>
           <li>
            A set is an ordered collection, so the order of list items would also change.
           </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
           However, we can use the
           <strong>
            set()
           </strong>
           function to convert a list into a Set.
          </p>
          <pre class="lang:python decode:true">weekdays = ['sun','mon','tue','wed','thu','fri','sat','sun','tue']

print(listAsSet)

#output: set(['wed', 'sun', 'thu', 'tue', 'mon', 'fri', 'sat'])</pre>
          <h4>
           Turn a list into a dictionary.
          </h4>
          <p>
           In a dictionary, each item represents a key-value pair. So converting a list isn‚Äôt as straightforward as it were for other data types.
          </p>
          <p>
           However, we can achieve the conversion by breaking the list into a set of pairs and then call the
           <strong>
            zip()
           </strong>
           function to return them as tuples.
          </p>
          <p>
           Passing the tuples into the
           <strong>
            dict()
           </strong>
           function would finally turn them into a dictionary.
          </p>
          <pre class="lang:python decode:true">weekdays = ['sun','mon','tue','wed','thu','fri']
listAsDict = dict(zip(weekdays[0::2], weekdays[1::2]))

           Q-98: How do you count the occurrences of each item present in the list without explicitly mentioning them?
          </h3>
          <p>
           Unlike sets, lists can have items with the same values.
          </p>
          <p>
           In Python, the list has a
           <strong>
            count()
           </strong>
           function which returns the occurrences of a particular item.

          <p>
           We‚Äôll use the list¬†comprehension¬†along with the
           <strong>
            count()
           </strong>
           method. It‚Äôll print the¬†frequency of each of the items.
          </p>
          <pre class="lang:python decode:true">weekdays = ['sun','mon','tue','wed','thu','fri','sun','mon','mon']
print([[x,weekdays.count(x)] for x in set(weekdays)])
